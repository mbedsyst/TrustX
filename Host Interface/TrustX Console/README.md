## Code Generation Notice

â“˜ This GUI was fully generated using OpenAI's ChatGPT, with real-time direction, feedback, and architectural decisions provided. I did not write any of the GUI code manually, but played the role of architect, tester, and integrator, ensuring the final application meets the standards for usability, structure, and design.
